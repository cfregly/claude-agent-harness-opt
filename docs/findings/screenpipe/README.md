# Screenpipe MCP Finding

Share link: [Screenpipe packet](https://github.com/cfregly/claude-agent-harness-opt/tree/main/docs/findings/screenpipe)

## Result

Confirmed improvement. This clears the adversarially-confirmed to add value bar.

The live Anthropic prompt JSON run moved from 6/7 to 7/7.

## What Failed

The baseline chose `search-content` for exact phrase lookup:

```text
Find every screen or transcript where I typed or saw the exact phrase "Stripe webhook" yesterday.
```

That is too broad for a literal keyword task. Screenpipe has a dedicated `keyword-search` tool.

The tuned version chose `keyword-search`.

## Suggested Change

Make the split explicit:

```text
Use keyword-search for literal terms and exact phrases.

Use search-content for transcript lines, screen text, speaker or window filters, tags, memories,
and broader content search.
```
